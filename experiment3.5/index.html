				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This program generates an overworld with inspiration drawn from route 204 from Pokemon. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The world is generated using the random function at the core of each component. The forests always create a border on the east and the west but will vary in depth. 
					The density of the trees around the edges of the forest are also randomly generated to create some variety. The path is also randomly generated but with
					heavy constraints to maintain some consistancy. The starting position of the path varies between the north and the south and is constrained to be in a relatively central
					location around the center of the screen.  
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I had a hard time with thinking of ways to utilize noise and other forms of randomness. I found a few ways to use random but most elements are pretty similar in their generation methods. 
					Most of this is due to starting late and not dedicating enough time to finding sources to imitate and learn from. Even though the end result wasn't what I was aiming for initially, I was still
				happy with the lake shapes that I was able to generate by overlapping smaller rectangles. </p>
